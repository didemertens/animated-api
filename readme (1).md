# Express API Authentication Lab
Taking the starter code provided add authentication to the existing API.

## Deliverables
You should submit a fully working API has authenticated routes and register and login endpoints. The API should return a JWT token at login, which can be used to access specific endpoints that would otherwise be unavailable.
You will need to make a user model, secure route middleware and authentication endpoints.

## Tips
* Work slowly toward your goal, and test frequently as you go.
* Do not copy / paste from code you have written during class, this will not help you understand how everything fits together.
* Use the seeds file to reset the database if you need.

# RESTful API

## Introduction

Your task is to build a RESTful Express API! You should include INDEX and CREATE for a single resource. There is no starter code for this assignment, so you should build everything from scratch.

There is nothing to stop you from copy / pasting from the classwork you have done today, but if you do **you will not learn anything** from this homework.

Instead we advise that you build out the API slowly and test as you go.

### Requirements

Use your lesson notes along with the classwork from today as a reference.

* You should have one model (of your choice)
* You should be able to perform INDEX and CREATE actions
* Include a seeds file

### Bonus

* Have a go at adding the other RESTful routes: SHOW, UPDATE and DELETE.
